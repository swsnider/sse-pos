POS Redesign

Mike's feature requests:
* Make it easier to change the amount of discount a tag color provides
* Need to record the actual deposit amount for a day along with an explanation
* Have actual monthly reports, including a sales tax due report.
* Attach an email address or something to each sale to keep information about repeat sales
* Gift certificates and donations both need to be able to be entered.

Biggest single change:
    When a transaction is entered, the items/prices are not *linked* but are, instead, *copied*.

More minor changes:
* record all amounts as cents, rather than dollars
*
